# DownForecast: Unit 10â€”A Yen for the Future

# Description
This assignment is based on programming analysis using pandas and scikitlearn with the substance of the JPY/CAD exchange rate
There will also be some plots for visual purposes. From what you can initially see , there is a downtrend of this rate.
Subsequent code will analyze this and prove it to be true for the whole time frame and partial time frame.

# Requirements
A Hodrick-Prescott filter will be used to view the price vs trend, and see what the noise looks like.
ARMA and ARIMA Model will forecast the returns (pct change) and calculate the P Value which will tell us if it is a good fit.
GARCH Model will be used to forecast the next 5 days and predict the volatility.
Linear Regression will be used to view the root mean squared error for in sample and out of sample performance.
Out of sample meaning datasets not known to the model, and in sample meaning datasets known to the model for performance testing

# Approach
Unit 10 Time series analysis unit notebooks will be used for ARMA , ARIMA and GARCH Models Lesson 2, `
