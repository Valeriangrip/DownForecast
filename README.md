# DownForecast: Unit 10â€”A Yen for the Future

# Description
This assignment is based on programming analysis using pandas and scikitlearn with the substance of the JPY/CAD exchange rate
There will also be some plots for visual purposes. From what you can initially see , there is a downtrend of this rate.
Subsequent code will analyze this and prove it to be true for the whole time frame and partial time frame.

# Requirements
A Hodrick-Prescott filter will be used to view the price vs trend, and see what the noise looks like.
ARMA Model will forecast the returns (pct change) and calculate the P Value which will tell us if it is a good fit.
ARIMA Model will be used to forecase the next 5 days and predict the volatility.

Linear Regression will be used to view the root mean squared error for in sample and out of sample performance.
Out of sample meaning
